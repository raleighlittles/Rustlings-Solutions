// errors3.rs
// This is a program that is trying to use a completed version of the
// `total_cost` function from the previous exercise. It's not working though!
// Why not? What should we do to fix it?
// Execute `rustlings hint errors3` for hints!

// Note: This was tricky. The change that you need to make was only added in newer versions of Rust,
// so any information you find on the web might be outdated, be careful.
// Also, think hard about what is really in a Result.
